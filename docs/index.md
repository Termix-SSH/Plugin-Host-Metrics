Host Metrics shows live stats for your Linux hosts: CPU, memory, disk, network, temperature, NVIDIA GPUs, processes, open ports and logins. It keeps history for charts, runs health checks, and has managers for services, packages, cron jobs, the firewall, users, certificates, logs and WireGuard.

Everything is read over SSH. There is no agent to install.

## Open it

Pick **Host Metrics** from a host's menu. Metrics are on for every host at first. Turn them off for a host in its Host Metrics settings.

Host Metrics only works on Linux. It reads `/proc` and standard tools, so Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Alpine and most others work. Windows, macOS and BSD don't.

## Layout

The page is made of cards. Drag them to rearrange, resize them, and turn cards on or off. The layout is saved per host.

The cards: CPU, memory, disk, network, temperature, GPU, uptime, system info, top processes, listening ports, recent logins and firewall status.

The terminal toolbar shows small CPU, memory and disk bars for the host you are in.

## History

The clock button on a card opens its history chart: the last 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or a range you pick.

Samples are taken while someone is looking at a host, every 30 seconds by default. Admins set **Metrics interval** and **History retention**, 7 days by default, in **Settings**, **Host Metrics**. A host can set its own interval.

## Managers

Manager cards let you change a host, not just watch it:

| Manager   | What you can do                                                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Services  | Start, stop, restart, enable and disable systemd services.                               |
| Packages  | Search, install, remove and upgrade packages, with apt, dnf, yum, pacman, zypper or apk. |
| Cron      | See and edit cron jobs.                                                                  |
| Firewall  | See and change firewall rules.                                                           |
| Users     | See and manage local users.                                                              |
| SSL       | See certificates on the host and when they expire.                                       |
| Logs      | Read the journal and log files.                                                          |
| WireGuard | See and manage WireGuard interfaces.                                                     |

Changes run with sudo. Save the host's **Sudo Password** so Termix can answer the prompt, or you'll be asked.

## Health checks

Health checks watch something on a schedule, like a URL answering or a service running, and show when it fails. [Automations](/plugins/automations) can act on a check changing.

## What the SSH user needs

Most stats come from files anyone can read. A few need more:

| Stat                   | Needs                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Failed logins          | Read access to `/var/log/auth.log` or `/var/log/secure`. |
| Process names on ports | sudo, for `ss -tulpn`.                                   |
| Firewall rules         | sudo, for `iptables` or `nft`.                           |
| GPU                    | `nvidia-smi` installed.                                  |

Without them, those parts are empty. The rest still works.

## With other plugins

- [Automations](/plugins/automations) can run when a metric crosses a line or a health check changes.
- [Homepage](/plugins/homepage) gets a **Metrics Chart** widget.
- The dashboard's host status card shows each host's numbers.

Who can use it is set by the `host-metrics.use` permission. Admins and users have it at first.
